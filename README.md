Playing around with [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app) and [iVim](https://github.com/terrychou/iVim) on my iPad.

## Getting started

1. Install iVim.
1. In Files, create a new folder: *On My iPad* -> *iVim* -> `ivim`.
1. In Working Copy, clone this repo.
1. In Working Copy, inside the repo, click the dropdown menu next to the repo's name at the top, and set up sync with that `ivim` folder you just made.
1. In iVim, `:e .vimrc` and set the content to `source ~/ivim/.vimrc`.
